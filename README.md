## Compatibility
This SDK relies on the React Context API and therefore requires React 16.3 or higher.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @flagsync/react-sdk

# yarn
yarn add @flagsync/react-sdk

# pnpm
pnpm add @flagsync/react-sdk
```

## Getting Started

Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.flagsync.com/sdks/react) for more information on how to use this library.


## Node / JavaScript

This SDK wraps the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/flagsync/javascript-client) for smoother integration with React applications. However, if you're building a non-React application for Node.js or the web browser, you should use our isomorphic [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/flagsync/javascript-client) instead.
